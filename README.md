# HeroHeader
Hero header with animated text, background and a down arrow indicating the user to scroll down.

## Getting started

Just download/clone/fork the repo, open the folder with your favourite text editor and compile the Sass files. After that, open `index.html` and everything should be working fine.

*I recommend using VSCode with a Sass Compiler extension to make your life easier*
